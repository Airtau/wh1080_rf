Fine Offset WH1080 Raspberry Pi RFM01 OOK RF Reader

Some experimental code to drive an RFM01 RF receiver from a Raspberry Pi
to read transmissions from a Fine Offset WH1080 weather station.

There's more information on this at www.susa.net/wordpress, and the links
on that page (some in the comments section) direct you to forum threads
that further discuss the subject.

Don't expect this to be a stable or reliable setup. It may be, but there are
environmental factors that can prevent you from getting a consistently clear
RF signal, and there can be problems getting a consistently stable Raspberry
Pi!
